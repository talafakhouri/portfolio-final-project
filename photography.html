        <img src="images/bana.JPG" alt="Girl posing infront of a projection">
        <figcaption>This photo was the result of me exploring the idea of projections, and how a human model can interact with a very geometrical and intricate projection. The result was a very beautiful juxtaposition of the organic and the artificial. </figcaption>

        <img src="images/bana2.JPG" alt="Girl putting makeup on">
        <figcaption>This photo was part of a prompt called "Organized Chaos" Which I decided to portray through the action of a girl putting make-up on. While her make-up looks unconventional, or chaotic, you can still recognize that there is some intention, and organization behind it.  </figcaption>

        <img src="images/miami.jpg" alt="building with interesting color">
        <figcaption> This photo was taken in Miami, Florida. I thought that this shot was interesting as the light from the building was being reflected  onto the fog around the top of the building. Which created this very interesting effect. </figcaption>

    <figcaption> This was a series of photographs I took of my friend. The inspiration behind this photoshoot came from a television show I was watching at the time called Euphoria. This show tackled many modern issues in a very beautiful style. Vibrant colors, dramatic posing, and using mixed media was my best way of portraying that through this series. </figcaption>
