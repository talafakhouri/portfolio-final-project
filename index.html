    <p> Hello! my name is Tala Fakhouri and I was born and raised in Amman, Jordan. I am currently a sophomore at the George Washington university with an undecided major in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. I created this portfolio for my information systems class (shoutout Professor Rossetti) but also to showcase some things I recently have been proud of. This portfolio is an accurate representation of how I view the world around me,and the work it entails is a collection of different projects, brainstorming, and acts of curiosity and boredom. Welcome to my portfolio: Talas Pics!
    </p>
    <p>Some of my interests</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>From taking pictures of friends and family, to taking pictures of one of the wonders of the world. Photography has always been a great hobby of mine, and a great way for me to capture all the memories that I would like to remember and pass on. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Graphic design</h3>
            <p> I was introduced to graphic design by one of my highschool art teachers, and have been learning about it ever since. I think that as time has progressed I have learned more about it and love to have it as a skill and a hobby.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> Music </h3>
            <p>Music has always been a great passion of mine, and I think it was important to mention although this portfolio is not music related, I think its a big part of who I am. I can garuntee that none of these pieces were completed without one of my playlists playing in the background, as music has always driven me creatively.</p>
